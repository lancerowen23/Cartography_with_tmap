# Elegant Cartography with tmap
This project served to demonstrate how to create a choropleth map using R for a group of GIS Analysts who wanted to learn more about using R as an alternative to proprietary GIS platforms. A major focus of the code was specifying arguments to create a sophisiticated looking static map of publishable quality. I also stressed the importance of using JSON and GeoJSON files for geometry rather than the more cumbersome and less flexible shapefile format. The package of choice for the mapping is tmap.
